# Change Log

Example section

>### [v0.1.0] - 2017-12-21
>#### Added
>- CHANGELOG documentation

The `verbs` should be consistent set such as **added**, **changed**
or **fixed**. Do not try to create meaningful nomenclature through
these sections but instead logically group the types of changes together.

If you don't know the release number or the date simply create a **TBD**
section such as this:

>### [TBD] - TBD
>#### Changed
>- Something I've changed and decided to add this to the release log

---

### [v0.1.0] - TBD
#### Added
- Initial release of the `atlantis` project
